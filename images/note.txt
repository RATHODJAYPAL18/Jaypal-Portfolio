Hi, I’m Jaypal. I come from a non-technical background, 
but I decided to pursue a career in IT after completing 12th.

In the beginning, I struggled to understand basic coding, but I didn’t give up. 
I explored different fields in IT and 
chose to become a MERN Stack Developer — with a strong focus on backend development.

Now, I’ve built a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and databases like PostgreSQL.
 I’m currently working on real projects and preparing for an internship in the next 6 months.

I’m passionate about backend development, always eager to learn, 
and ready to grow in a professional environment.
